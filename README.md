swiftjs
=======

A compiler for the swift language to Javascript.

Swift is cool. Javascript (V8) is cool.
The aim of this project is to write swift in nodejs for server-side development.

Something relevant and interesting:
 * [emscripten][1], a llvm to javascript transformer so you can do swift to llvm to js
 * [clojurescript][2], a clojure compiler to js

I got the idea tonight. You are here now so we may share the same ideas. Drop me an email and tell me what you are thinking about it: evanliuchina (AT) gmail (DOT) com.

Coming soon... :)
